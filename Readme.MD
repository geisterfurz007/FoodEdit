# FoodEdit

This absolutely useless userscript edits your last message to some random food ingredient as stackoverflow tag!

## WHY?!

Because I felt like it!

## How?!

Some Javascript here, some request there, some... Oh? You were asking how to install?  

1. Install TamperMonkey [for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)  / [for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/) or [Greasemonkey for FF](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
2. Click to [install](https://github.com/geisterfurz007/FoodEdit/raw/master/WaffleEdits.user.js)
3. Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey should open up and give you the option to install the extension

## Mhmm?

Oh right! You have to use it somehow, don't you... Nothing simpler as that. Your chat will have a new button right next to your input area. Click it and bang! Cabbage! Or peas! Or whatever!

![This is how it should look like](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KhHG6.png "This is how it should look like")

Probably not as dark in the back but just as button.

## WHAT?!

Oh... You are asking why there is something horrible like pineapple-pizza or icecream-bread in there? I got [peer pressured](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/message/47029030#47029030) to merging that PR, I AM SORRY!!!
